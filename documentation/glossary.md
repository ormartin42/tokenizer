# GLOSSARY

## BLOCK <a name="block"></a>
A block is a collection of data, typically consisting of a list of transactions, that is permanently recorded on the blockchain. Each block is linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks, hence the term "blockchain."

## BLOCKCHAIN <a name="chain"></a>
A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

## BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER
A blockchain explorer is a tool that provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching data on a blockchain. It allows users to track transactions, check wallet balances, and view block details. Examples include Etherscan for Ethereum and Blockchain.info for Bitcoin.

## COIN <a name="coin"></a>

A coin is a type of cryptocurrency that operates independently on its own blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain). Coins are used primarily as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.

## CRYPTO(CURRENCY) <a name="crypto"></a>

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

## DAPP (Decentralized Application) <a name="dapp"></a>
A dApp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. Unlike traditional apps, dApps are open-source, and their backend code runs on a distributed peer-to-peer network.

## ERC-20
ERC-20 is a technical standard used for creating and issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens created with this standard are interoperable, meaning they can be used across different platforms, wallets, and dApps that support ERC-20. Most tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem follow this standard.

## ETHER <a name="ether"></a>
Ether is a cryptocurrency used in Ethereum's global virtual machine. It has several uses: It is used to pay network participants for their contributions to the blockchain. Investors use it as a store of value, and traders use it to take advantage of price movements. Consumers can use it to pay for goods and services at businesses that accept it.

## ETHEREUM <a name="ethereum"></a>
Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology. It is most commonly known by investors for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), and by developers for its use in blockchain and decentralized finance application development.

## ETHERSCAN
Etherscan is a popular blockchain explorer specifically for the Ethereum network. It allows users to view detailed information about Ethereum transactions, wallet balances, smart contracts, token transfers, and more. Etherscan is widely used for monitoring the status of transactions and exploring blockchain data.

## FAUCET
A faucet is a website or application that gives out small amounts of cryptocurrency for free, usually to help users learn about the currency or to test transactions on a blockchain network.

## GWEI
Gwei is a denomination of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), used on the Ethereum network to buy and sell goods and services. A gwei is one-billionth of one ETH.

## INFURA
Infura is a service that provides access to Ethereum and IPFS networks without needing to run a full node. Developers use Infura to connect their dApps to the Ethereum blockchain easily.

## LEDGER <a name="ledger"></a>
A ledger is a record-keeping system that stores information about transactions. In blockchain, the ledger is distributed across all nodes in the network and is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once recorded.

## MAINNET <a name="mainnet"></a>
The mainnet (short for "main network") is the primary network of a blockchain where real transactions occur and real value is exchanged. It is the production environment where the actual blockchain operates with live data, and transactions have real economic consequences.

## METAMASK <a name="metamask"></a>
MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain applications. It is a browser extension that allows users to manage their Ethereum accounts, interact with dApps, and store tokens securely.

## MINER <a name="miner"></a>
A miner is a participant in a blockchain network who validates transactions and creates new blocks by solving complex cryptographic puzzles. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## NODE <a name="node"></a>
In the context of blockchain technology, a node is a device or computer that participates in a blockchain network. Each node has a copy of the entire blockchain and helps to maintain and validate the network's data. Nodes communicate with each other to ensure that all copies of the blockchain are consistent and up-to-date.

Types of Nodes:

- **Full Node**: A node that has a complete copy of the blockchain and validates all transactions and blocks. Full nodes ensure that the network operates according to the protocol rules. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain by verifying and storing all data.
- **Light Node (or Lightweight Node)**: A node that does not store the entire blockchain but instead only downloads the block headers and requests necessary data from full nodes. Light nodes rely on full nodes for complete blockchain data and are used primarily to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements.
- **Mining Node**: A type of full node that participates in the process of creating new blocks (mining) and securing the network. Mining nodes compete to solve complex mathematical problems and, upon solving them, add new blocks to the blockchain and receive rewards.
- **Validator Node**: A special type of full node that participates in “consensus.” By participating in consensus, validator nodes become responsible for verifying, voting on, and maintaining a record of transactions.

## OPENZEPPELIN
OpenZeppelin is a widely used open-source framework and library for developing secure and reliable smart contracts on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. It provides a suite of reusable and well-audited smart contract components, which help developers build decentralized applications (dApps) more efficiently and securely

## POOL
A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of solving a block on the blockchain. The rewards are then shared among the pool members based on the amount of work contributed.

## REMIX <a name="remix"></a>
Remix is an open-source, web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used for writing, compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## SEPOLIA <a name="sepolia"></a>
Sepolia is an Ethereum test network (testnet) used by developers to test smart contracts and dApps without using real cryptocurrency. It mimics the behavior of the Ethereum mainnet but uses test Ether (ETH) instead of real ETH.

## SOLIDITY
Solidity is a high-level programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and other compatible blockchains. It is statically typed and supports object-oriented programming, making it suitable for developing complex smart contracts.

## SMART CONTRACT <a name="smart-contract"></a>
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. The contract automatically enforces and executes the terms when certain conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

## TESTNET <a name="testnet"></a>
The testnet is a separate network used for testing and development purposes. It mimics the mainnet but operates with test currencies or tokens, allowing developers to experiment without risking real assets.

## TOKEN <a name="token"></a>
A token is a digital asset created on a blockchain, typically representing ownership, access, or value. Unlike coins, tokens are built on existing blockchains (e.g., ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum). Tokens can represent anything from assets to utility in a dApp.

## WALLET <a name="wallet"></a>
A wallet is a software or hardware tool that stores private and public keys for cryptocurrencies. It allows users to send, receive, and manage their digital assets securely. Wallets can be custodial (managed by a third party) or non-custodial (fully controlled by the user).
